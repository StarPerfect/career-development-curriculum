# Outreach & Networking Plan
As we've discussed, meeting people, forming relationships, and having conversations are the key pieces to getting your foot in the door at any company. It's important to be proactive in your approach to outreach and networking, so it's necessary to make a plan for what you'll try to further your networking. 

Identify a contact you will reach out to by the end of this module. This could be a mentor, alum, or anyone from your current network. Describe:

Person: My mentor, Anna Lewis

1. Why you want to connect with this person and what you want to talk about: she's my mentor, got a great job downtown working in a side of tech that she's passionate about, has flexability at her job, and is I think a great person to start my outreach with 
2. When you will contact them by and how you plan to meet: we meet every Thursday for 2 hours so I'd like to ask her to coffee on a separate date in a different setting to discuss networking
3. What your follow-up will look like once you've met with them: I will write her a thank you email and depending on our conversation, follow up on the suggestions she provides
4. What other steps will you take to start building a stronger network in the tech community? I'm going to my first civic tech meetup (Code for Denver) tonight to start building this up)
